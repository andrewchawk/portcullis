## TODO
- add to Main usage message
    - date compiler built
    - ascii logo (maybe) :)
- double check runtime examples didn't break after all that mucking

- write typechecking unit tests for tuples
- disallow stream signatures that contain either unspecified types or arrows
    - this makes sense b/c streams should be very simple data cells that are read/writeable from external sources

## Refinement
Z + Z = Z
Z - Z = Z
Z * Z = Z
Z / Z = R

R + R = R
R - R = R
R * R = R
R / R = R


## Done
- update vim theme for latest syntax (done but not pushed)
