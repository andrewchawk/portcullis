## TODO

- write typechecking unit tests for tuples
- disallow stream signatures that contain either unspecified types or arrows
    - this makes sense b/c streams should be very simple data cells that are read/writeable from external sources

- fix Equal in python to return 0/1 instead of True/False
- add foldl/r to tests

## Done
- update vim theme for latest syntax (done but not pushed)
